StageA
	Imagine a unique social project that takes a web server and turns it into a multiplayer hub for a purposeful cause. The goal? To create a space where people come together, enjoy games or activities, and contribute to a shared fund. This fund isn’t just any fund – it’s a resource that automatically gets divided among the users of the server. So, the more you engage and participate, the more you receive from the fund. This innovative project not only brings people closer through fun and interaction but also enables them to collectively impact their community by distributing funds where they’re needed most.

StageB
	Now, envision a stage 2 of this project where the same server takes innovation a step further by integrating blockchain technology. This powerful addition ensures even greater transparency and fairness in distributing the collective funds. Every transaction and distribution becomes untraceable, tamper-proof, and secure. This blockchain-backed approach not only maintains the spirit of rewarding participation but also adds an extra layer of trust and accountability, making the project’s impact even more profound. As users continue to engage and contribute, they can be confident that their efforts are making a tangible difference, both within the server’s community and in the wider world.

StageC
	Enter stage 3, where the project’s evolution takes an exciting turn. By integrating the Monero blockchain as a protocol layer within the Linux operating system, a revolutionary payment system emerges. This transformation adds an untraceable and easily accessible payment layer to every user’s system. This means seamless, private transactions right at users’ fingertips. By embedding this discreet payment capability into the OS, the project expands its potential impact, making financial engagement effortless and secure for users across the board.
